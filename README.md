# animetools

Personal tools to help maintain my anime collection.
Most go along with ubercow/biribiri


## ed2k
Quickly and easily get an ed2k hash from a file for easy AniDB.net CREQing


## animelist
Reads your flexget config's anime section and pretty prints a list of the anime
and the from_group tag.


## qualitycheck
Looks for files formatted in biribiri format and lists the episode number, source and resolution.
Good for finding which releases you need to upgrade to bluray rips.
